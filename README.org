# my-guix-packages
You can find here my public channel of Guix packages for testing.

Update your =~/.config/guix/channels.scm= according to this sample configuration:

#+begin_src scheme

(cons* (channel
	(name 'bric-a-brac)
	(url "https://github.com/altomcat/bric-a-brac.git")
        (introduction
	 (make-channel-introduction
	  "cb7dbb3911da911e06146d4a7bde372c4b5a4783"
	  (openpgp-fingerprint
	   "AA52 B3F3 E764 5F95 6BA1 23E2 43D7 A3F7 7931 A85D")))
	)
        ;; (channel ...)   ;  other external channels
       %default-channels)

#+end_src

Don't forget to run a /guix pull/ to take into account the new channel!

#+begin_src shell

guix pull

# Install guile-pstk library
guix install guile-pstk

#+end_src

/Note : ~font-iosevka-comfy~  and ~emacs-substitute~ has been merged to guix master branch./
